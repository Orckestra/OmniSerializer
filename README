This project is a fork of [NetSerializer](https://github.com/tomba/netserializer) and add the following functionality:

- No longer requires the classes to be decorated with [Serializable]
  - Classes from the System.* and Microsoft.* namespaces without [Serializable] are not supported and will not be serialized
- Types to serialize are automatically detected.  
  - This is achieved by adding the type's name to the serialized stream instead of the 'TypeId' value
  - Fields are still serialized in the same order as NetSerializer so client and server must still have the same version.  An exception will be thrown if a class was modified since it was serialized (e.g.: different number of fields).
- Throws an exception when a circular reference is detected instead of generating a stack overflow
- A new dictionary serializer was created to:
    - Allow inheriting from a Dictionary<,>
    - Serialize the comparer
    - This new serializer requires a parameter less constructor
- New serializers:
    - Hashset
    - Hashtable
